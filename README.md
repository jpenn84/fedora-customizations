# Fedora Customizations

A script to make re-installing Fedora quicker and easier for myself. This script was created for my Fedora 40 KDE Spin installation, but will likely apply to future versions and/or other spins.

## Installation

Install Fedora 40 KDE Spin, then install git using:

```bash
  sudo dnf install -y git
```

Once git is installed, clone this repository to install.

## Usage

Navigate to the project directory and run using:

```bash
  ./customize.sh
```
